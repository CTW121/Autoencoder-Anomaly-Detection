# Autoencoder
- Implement, run, and analyze an autoencoder architect from scratch for anomaly detection purpose on MINST dataset.
- The MINST dataset contains thousands of images of handwritten digits and is commonly used for classification purposes.
- PyTorch is utilized.
- Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE) is implemented to improve the performance.
